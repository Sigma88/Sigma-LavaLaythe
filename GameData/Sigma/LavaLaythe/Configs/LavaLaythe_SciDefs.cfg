		%LaytheInSpaceHigh = From this distance, Laythe looks like an orange blob of mystery goo.
		%LaytheInSpaceLow = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin, if Kerbin was a fiery ball of death that melts everything on its path.
		%LaytheFlyingHigh = The ship is getting hotter from the heat of reentry. Or maybe it's all the magma down there irradiating the hull.
		%LaytheFlyingLow = Soot is everywhere. Even on the console, which is worrying.
		%LaytheSrfLandedSolidCrust = The crew looks outside, the landscape is breathtaking.
		%LaytheSrfLandedMeltingSurface = Not sure if this counts as a landeding or splash down. The terrain does not look very solid.
		%LaytheSrfSplashed = The crew does not approve.
